Markdown JavaDoc is a script that generates markdown javadocs primarily for use in Jekyll and GitHub Pages. It consists of two modules, an [API](./api) and [CLI](./cli). If you simply want to generate a set of javadocs in markdown without any scripting, the CLI provides a simple interface with a decent amount of options. If you have a more complex use case, however, it might be more beneficial to look into the API first.
