The Markdown Javadoc CLI is fairly simple. The contents of the `mdjavadoc --help` command are below.

```
Usage: mdjavadoc [options]

Options:

  -v --version				output the version number
  -o --output [path]		location to output generated files in
  -f --file [file]			a specific file to parse
  --filter [expression]		file name filter
  --dirfilter [expression]	dir name filter
  --prefix [url]			source code prefix
  -e --extensions			generate files with extensions
  -h --help					output usage information
```

More information about this program and how it works can be found in the [project README](https://jfenn.me/redirects/?t=github&d=mdjavadoc).

## Installation

### NPM

```shell
sudo npm install -g mdjavadoc
```

### From Source

```shell
git clone https://github.com/TheAndroidMaster/mdjavadoc
cd mdjavadoc/cli
sudo npm install -g
sudo npm link
```

## Arguments

### `--output`

By default, `mdjavadoc` parses every file (that doesn't start with a `.`) in the current directory and outputs the generated markdown in `./docs`. Specifying the `--output` argument changes this directory.

### `--file`

Since `mdjavadoc`'s default behavior is to parse every file in the current directory, the `--file` argument has no default behavior. If it is specified, the `--output` argument is no longer used as an output *directory* and can instead be used to specify the file to output markdown into. If `--output` is not specified, the output file name defaults to the name of the parsed file + ".md".

### `--filter`

This argument can be used to specify a RegEx statement to filter out unwanted files to parse in a directory. This argument defaults to `/^(?!\.).*/`, which will exclude any file name which begins with a ".". If you wanted to exclude all files except those which end in `.java`, you could set this argument to `".*(\\.java)$"`; likewise for any other file extension.

### `--dirfilter`

`--filter` but for directories.

### `--prefix`

This argument is used to specify a prefix to prepend to the source code URLs generated by the program. It defaults to `..`, which you would want if you were placing the docs in a folder with the rest of your source code, but is useless for just about anything else, so you will probably want to change this to your project's complete URL ("https://github.com/user/repository/blob/master").

### `--extensions`

This is used to specify whether extensions should be included in the output file names (the default is no). If this is specified, the markdown file for "ClassName.java" will become "ClassName.java.md" instead of just "ClassName.md".
